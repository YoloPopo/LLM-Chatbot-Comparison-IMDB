This is because the trigram sequences in the correct sentences (e.g., \"movie was surprisingly\", \"was surprisingly good\") are more likely to have occurred in the training data (or have higher smoothed probabilities) than the jumbled sequences in the incorrect sentences (e.g., \"good surprisingly was\", \"surprisingly was movie\").\n",

        "A lower perplexity indicates the model is less \"surprised\" by the sequence, meaning it assigns higher probabilities to the observed words given their context. The large difference between the two scores would suggest the n-gram model has captured some basic sequential structure of the English language present in the reviews.\n",

Quality can be decent but requires careful tuning and substantial training. It strikes a balance if pre-trained models are not an option or if full control over the architecture is needed.\n",
        "*   **Fine-tuned GPT-2:** High resource usage *during fine-tuning* (significant CPU time, high memory), but leverages massive pre-training. Offers the highest quality by far, especially for generation fluency and coherence. If the fine-tuning time (which is often less than training a large LSTM from scratch) is acceptable, **fine-tuned GPT-2 likely offers the best balance between *achievable quality* and *fine-tuning effort***, assuming the pre-trained model itself is available.\n",
